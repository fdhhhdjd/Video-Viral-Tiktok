# Commit Message Guidelines

To ensure our commit history is readable and understandable, please follow these commit message guidelines:

## Types of Commits

- `docs`: Documentation only changes.

- `fix`: Bug fixes.
- `perf`: Performance improvements.
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
- `revert`: Reverting a previous commit.
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
